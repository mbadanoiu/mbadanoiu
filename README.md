Q: Why do you write your CVEs as PDFs?

A: I use PDFs to responsably disclose the identified vulnerabilities to the respective software vendors. As I want to eventually post all +100 0-days, I needed a way to quicly modify and post them here without reworking them from scratch (rewriting them as Markdown is too labor intensive).

----

Q: Why do you (usually) not upload scripts and proof of concept code directly into repositories?

A: I do this because I want:
- People to read the PDF and understand the mechanisms and inner workings behind the exploit
- To prevent script kiddies from easily git cloning/copy-pasting and running the exploits without understanding what they do
