## Welcome to the Weekend Retreat of Matei "Mal" Badanoiu

This GitHub is used to post my CVEs and Security Research during my freetime/weekends.

All materials present in this GitHub profile are meant for security research and etichal hacking.

I do not condone malicious behavoiur such as hacking systems without being authorized to do so, ransomare, or any unethical use of my work.

### Whoami?

I am:
- Matei "Mal" Badanoiu
- Hacker
- Pentester by day
- Security researcher by night
- Owner of +100 responsably disclosed 0-days/CVEs

### Additional Information

Q: Why do you write your CVEs as PDFs?

A: I use PDFs to responsably disclose the identified vulnerabilities to the respective software vendors. As I want to eventually post all +100 0-days here, I needed a way to quicly modify and post them here without reworking them from scratch (rewriting them as Markdown is too labor intensive).

<br/>

Q: Why do you (usually) not upload scripts and proof of concept code directly into repositories?

A: I do this because I want:
- People to read the PDF and understand the mechanisms and inner workings behind the exploit
- To prevent script kiddies from easily git cloning/copy-pasting and running the exploits without understanding what they do
